	<p>  Twist and Shout is located at 2508 E Colfax Ave in Denver Colorado and it is easily one of the staples of the city and a must-see place. It was founded in 1988 by Paul Epstein and Jill Parrish. However, the original building was a different record store that had been there since 1968 and when the couple saw that it was closing, they decided to save it. It embodies the history and vibes of a classic music store with a variety of music formats that can appeal to everyone. They have CDs, vinyl records, tapes, record players, movies, toys, posters, apparel and much more. Customers can also sell their old musical collection and get cash or store credit for their items. This method allows the store to gain unique, rare, and vintage finds that its customers are looking for. You can easily spend anywhere from 20 minutes to two hours in the store because of all of the items they have to offer. The staff is friendly and well versed in all types of music and movies and collectables. Twist and Shout is dedicated to delight its customers with its wide array of articles and to keeping the music scene alive. </p></div>
